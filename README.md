# Design-Workshop
The design workshop space for SSW 345 lab 4 project

Group 7's focus bot would be used to increase team member productivity by solving the problem of avoiding late work and missed deadlines. This would avoid the stereotypical pitfalls many software designers face of extending schedule past their promised deadlines, which cause major losses for companies in increased cost of project and work hours billed, massively hindering the potential success of the project. Thus the idea of our bot is to increase this productivity by getting workers to start projects earlier and keep them actively engaged in their projects during working hours. As such we would be looking at a focus bot focused on the patterns of notifiers and space responders to accomplish these tasks. 

1. What is the core problem each bot is trying to solve?
The focus bot core function is to help team members be productive, solving the core problem of avoiding late work and not missing deadlines for upcoming assignments.

2. Why is it a problem worth solving?
The problem is worth solving because late work and missed deadlines causes issues in schedueling that causes companies money, work hours, and the success of project.
Projects may miss their predetermined release date or be filled with bugs, stemming from the problem of having work being submitted late.

3. What is the core product idea?
The product's core idea is to increase productivity in each stage of project by getting workers to start their projects earlier and keeping them on track during work hours.

4. What are patterns that might be useful?
Some patterns that might be useful are notifier that push notifications to the worker, space responders that will help keep workers on track while worker, when it senses some downtime or inactivity, it pushes alerts or plays music to help the worker stay focused.  

5. Design sketches: Use wireframes, storyboards, and flow maps to describe your problem.
